## Why Quality Control Matters

Quality control (QC) is the process of ensuring that products and services meet specific quality standards. It encompasses a range of activities, including inspection, testing, and analysis, aimed at identifying and rectifying defects or deviations from established requirements. Effective quality control systems are essential for:

*   **Customer Satisfaction:** Meeting or exceeding customer expectations is crucial for business success. Quality control helps ensure that products and services are reliable, durable, and perform as intended, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
*   **Reduced Costs:** Identifying and preventing defects early in the production process can significantly reduce waste, rework, and warranty claims. This leads to lower production costs and improved profitability.
*   **Enhanced Reputation:** Companies known for their commitment to quality enjoy a stronger reputation and a competitive advantage. Quality control helps build trust with customers and stakeholders, enhancing brand image and attracting new business.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Many industries are subject to strict quality regulations. Quality control ensures that products and services comply with these regulations, avoiding potential fines and legal issues.
