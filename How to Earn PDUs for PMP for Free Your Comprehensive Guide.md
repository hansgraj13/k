## Understanding PDU Requirements and Categories

Before diving into free PDU sources, it's crucial to understand the PDU requirements set by the Project Management Institute (PMI). You need to earn 60 PDUs per three-year cycle to maintain your PMP certification.  These PDUs fall into two main categories:

*   **Education PDUs:**  These PDUs are earned through structured learning activities like courses, webinars, seminars, and workshops. They are further categorized into the "Talent Triangle" areas:
    *   **Technical Project Management:** Skills related to the technical aspects of project management, such as scheduling, budgeting, and risk management.
    *   **Leadership:**  Skills related to motivating, influencing, and guiding project teams.
    *   **Strategic and Business Management:**  Skills related to aligning projects with organizational goals and understanding the business environment.
*   **Giving Back PDUs:** These PDUs are earned through activities that contribute to the project management profession and community, such as volunteering, creating content, and working as a professional.

The specific number of PDUs required in each category can change, so always refer to the PMI's official website for the most up-to-date information.

*   **Document Your Learning:**  Keep a record of the videos and podcasts you watch, along with notes on what you learned and how you applied it.

### 5. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
