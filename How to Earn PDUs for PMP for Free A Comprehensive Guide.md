*   **Total PDUs:** 60 PDUs every three years.
*   **Education PDUs:** A minimum of 35 PDUs in education. These PDUs must align with the PMI Talent Triangle:
    *   **Technical Project Management:** Skills related to specific project management methodologies.
    *   **Leadership:** Skills related to leading and motivating teams.
    *   **Strategic and Business Management:** Skills related to aligning projects with organizational goals.
*   **Giving Back PDUs:** A maximum of 25 PDUs can be earned by "giving back" to the profession. This category includes activities such as volunteering, creating content, working as a professional, etc.

## Free PDU Earning Opportunities: Education

Here are some excellent ways to earn free education PDUs:

**1. PMI Website & Events:**

*   **PMI Events:** PMI (Project Management Institute) often hosts free webinars, local chapter events, and online presentations. These events frequently offer PDUs. Check the PMI website and your local chapter's calendar for upcoming opportunities.
*   **PMI Standards:** Deeply reviewing and understanding the PMI standards like the PMBOKÂ® Guide (Project Management Body of Knowledge) can be claimed as PDUs. Document your review and reflect on how it influences your project management practices.
*   **PMI Podcasts & Articles:** The PMI website also hosts various podcasts, webinars and articles that can be a great source of knowledge that can be claimed as PDUs. Be sure to keep detailed notes on what you learned!

**2. Employer-Provided Training:**

*   **Internal Training Programs:** Many organizations offer internal training programs to their employees. Check with your HR department or training manager to see if any of these programs align with the PMI Talent Triangle and qualify for PDUs. Even if the training isn't explicitly PMP-related, if it enhances your leadership, strategic thinking, or technical project management skills, it can potentially be claimed.
*   **Lunch and Learns:** Organize "lunch and learn" sessions within your team or department. Invite colleagues to share their expertise on project management topics. You can claim PDUs for both presenting and attending these sessions.

**3. Online Learning Platforms (Free Tiers & Promotions):**

*   **Coursera & edX (Audit Option):** Coursera and edX offer a wide range of project management courses. While a certificate often requires payment, many courses allow you to "audit" them for free. This means you can access the course materials, watch the videos, and learn the content without completing assignments or receiving a certificate. Document your learning hours to claim PDUs.
*   **YouTube:** YouTube is a treasure trove of free educational content. Search for "project management," "PMP," "Agile," "leadership," and other relevant keywords to find lectures, tutorials, and presentations.
*   **Vendor Webinars & Workshops:** Software vendors and consulting firms often host free webinars and workshops on topics related to project management. These events are typically designed to promote their products or services, but they can also provide valuable insights and earn you PDUs.

**4. Local Libraries and Community Centers:**

*   **Books and Articles:** Read project management books and articles from your local library or online resources. You can claim PDUs for the time you spend reading and reflecting on the material.
*   **Free Workshops and Seminars:** Check your local library and community centers for free workshops and seminars on topics related to leadership, communication, and other skills relevant to project management.

**5. Project Management Software Free Trials:**

Many project management software vendors offer free trials of their products. While the primary intention is to evaluate the software, using these trials can be a learning experience. You can gain hands-on experience with different project management tools and techniques, which can be claimed as PDUs. Document the time spent learning and experimenting with the software.

**6. Free Online Project Management Communities:**

*   **LinkedIn Groups:** Engage in discussions and knowledge sharing within relevant LinkedIn groups. Participating actively and contributing valuable insights can be considered informal learning and documented for PDU claims.
*   **Online Forums:** Platforms like Quora and Reddit have dedicated project management communities where you can learn from experienced professionals, ask questions, and share your knowledge.
