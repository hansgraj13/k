## Understanding Vercel for Students

Vercel is a popular platform as a service (PaaS) primarily used for deploying frontend websites and web applications. It's known for its ease of use, speed, and seamless integration with popular frontend frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue.js, and Angular. Here's why it's particularly attractive to students:

*   **Simplified Deployment:** Vercel automates the deployment process, allowing students to focus on writing code instead of configuring servers. You simply connect your Git repository, and Vercel takes care of the rest.
*   **Global CDN:** Vercel utilizes a global content delivery network (CDN), ensuring that your website is delivered quickly to users around the world. This is crucial for performance and user experience.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Vercel supports serverless functions, which allows you to write backend logic in languages like Node.js, Python, and Go, without managing servers. This is ideal for building APIs and handling dynamic content.
*   **Preview Deployments:** Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for every pull request, making it easy to review changes before merging them into the main branch. This is invaluable for collaboration and code quality.
*   **Scalability:** Vercel automatically scales your application to handle traffic spikes, ensuring that your website remains available even under heavy load.
