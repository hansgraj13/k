## What Does an Intern Web Developer Do?

An intern web developer is a junior member of a development team, gaining practical experience by assisting senior developers in various tasks. The specific responsibilities vary depending on the company and the project, but some common duties include:

*   **Writing Code:**  Contributing to the front-end (what users see) or back-end (the server-side logic) of a website or application. This involves writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, or Ruby.
*   **Testing and Debugging:** Identifying and fixing errors in code to ensure the functionality and stability of the website or application.
*   **Collaborating with Team Members:** Working closely with designers, project managers, and other developers to achieve project goals.  This often involves participating in code reviews, brainstorming sessions, and daily stand-up meetings.
*   **Learning New Technologies:** Web development is a constantly evolving field, so interns are expected to learn new technologies and frameworks quickly.
*   **Maintaining Existing Code:** Fixing bugs and implementing small features in existing websites or applications.
*   **Contributing to Documentation:**  Creating and updating technical documentation for code and processes.
*   **Assisting with Website Design:**  Depending on the company, an intern might contribute to the visual design and user experience of a website.
*   **Data Handling:** Working with databases and APIs to retrieve, store, and manipulate data.

## Essential Skills for Aspiring Intern Web Developers

To land a web development internship, you'll need to demonstrate a solid understanding of the following core skills:

While not always required, possessing these skills can significantly boost your chances of landing an internship:

*   **JavaScript Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js):**  These frameworks streamline the development process and are highly sought after by employers.
