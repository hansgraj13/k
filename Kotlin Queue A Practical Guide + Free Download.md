## What is a Queue?

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first element removed. Think of it like a line at a grocery store – the first person in line is the first person to be served.

Key operations associated with a queue are:

*   **Enqueue (or offer):**  Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
*   **Dequeue (or poll):** Removes the element from the front of the queue.
*   **Peek:** Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
*   **isEmpty:** Checks if the queue is empty.
*   **size:** Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Implementing Queues in Kotlin

Kotlin doesn't have a built-in `Queue` interface that's immediately ready to use with concrete implementations directly in its standard library the same way Java does.  However, we can use Kotlin's powerful features to implement queues in various ways.  Here are a few common approaches:

### 1. Using `LinkedList` as a Queue

The `LinkedList` class in the Kotlin standard library (part of the Java standard library) implements the `Deque` interface, which provides methods for both queue and stack operations. We can use it to implement a queue easily.

```kotlin
import java.util.*

fun main() {
    val queue: Queue<String> = LinkedList<String>()

    // Enqueue elements
    queue.offer("First")
    queue.offer("Second")
    queue.offer("Third")

    println("Queue: $queue") // Output: Queue: [First, Second, Third]

    // Dequeue elements
    val firstElement = queue.poll()
    println("Dequeued: $firstElement") // Output: Dequeued: First
    println("Queue after dequeue: $queue") // Output: Queue after dequeue: [Second, Third]

    // Peek at the front element
    val frontElement = queue.peek()
    println("Front element: $frontElement") // Output: Front element: Second

    // Check if the queue is empty
    println("Is queue empty? ${queue.isEmpty()}") // Output: Is queue empty? false

    // Get the size of the queue
    println("Queue size: ${queue.size}") // Output: Queue size: 2
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   We create a `Queue` of `String` using `LinkedList`.
*   `offer()` adds elements to the rear of the queue.
*   `poll()` removes and returns the element at the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns `null`.
*   `peek()` returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns `null`.
*   `isEmpty()` checks if the queue is empty.
*   `size` returns the number of elements in the queue.

This approach is simple and efficient for most use cases.  However, `LinkedList` can have performance overhead due to its node-based structure, especially for very large queues.

### 2. Implementing a Queue with an `ArrayList`

While `ArrayList` is primarily designed for random access, it can be used to implement a queue.  However, dequeueing from the front of an `ArrayList` is an O(n) operation because it requires shifting all subsequent elements.  Therefore, it's generally less efficient than using `LinkedList` for queue operations.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val queue: MutableList<String> = ArrayList()

    // Enqueue elements
    queue.add("First")
    queue.add("Second")
    queue.add("Third")

    println("Queue: $queue") // Output: Queue: [First, Second, Third]

    // Dequeue elements
    val firstElement = queue.removeAt(0)
    println("Dequeued: $firstElement") // Output: Dequeued: First
    println("Queue after dequeue: $queue") // Output: Queue after dequeue: [Second, Third]

    // Peek at the front element
    val frontElement = queue.getOrNull(0)
    println("Front element: $frontElement") // Output: Front element: Second

    // Check if the queue is empty
    println("Is queue empty? ${queue.isEmpty()}") // Output: Is queue empty? false

    // Get the size of the queue
    println("Queue size: ${queue.size}") // Output: Queue size: 2
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use a `MutableList<String>` backed by an `ArrayList` to represent the queue.
*   `add()` adds elements to the end of the list (acting as enqueue).
*   `removeAt(0)` removes the element at the beginning of the list (acting as dequeue).  This is the inefficient part.
*   `getOrNull(0)` safely gets the first element, returning `null` if the list is empty (acting as peek).

**When to consider `ArrayList`:** If the queue rarely experiences dequeue operations and is primarily used for adding and iterating, `ArrayList` might be acceptable. However, for frequent enqueue and dequeue operations, `LinkedList` is generally preferred.

### 3. Implementing a Circular Queue

A circular queue is a fixed-size queue that reuses the empty spaces created during dequeue operations.  It's implemented using an array and two pointers: `front` and `rear`.  When the `rear` pointer reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning if there's available space.  Circular queues are useful when you have a fixed-size buffer and want to avoid shifting elements during dequeue operations.

```kotlin
class CircularQueue<T>(private val capacity: Int) {
    private val array: Array<Any?> = arrayOfNulls(capacity)
    private var front = 0
    private var rear = -1
    private var size = 0

    fun enqueue(item: T) {
        if (isFull()) {
            throw IllegalStateException("Queue is full")
        }
        rear = (rear + 1) % capacity
        array[rear] = item
        size++
    }

    fun dequeue(): T {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw NoSuchElementException("Queue is empty")
        }
        val item = array[front] as T
        array[front] = null // Help with garbage collection
        front = (front + 1) % capacity
        size--
        return item
    }

    fun peek(): T? {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            return null
        }
        return array[front] as T
    }

    fun isEmpty(): Boolean {
        return size == 0
    }

    fun isFull(): Boolean {
        return size == capacity
    }

    fun getSize(): Int {
        return size
    }
}

fun main() {
    val queue = CircularQueue<Int>(5)
    queue.enqueue(1)
    queue.enqueue(2)
    queue.enqueue(3)
    queue.enqueue(4)
    queue.enqueue(5)

    println("Queue size: ${queue.getSize()}") // Output: Queue size: 5
    println("Dequeued: ${queue.dequeue()}") // Output: Dequeued: 1
    println("Dequeued: ${queue.dequeue()}") // Output: Dequeued: 2
    println("Queue size: ${queue.getSize()}") // Output: Queue size: 3

    queue.enqueue(6)
    println("Queue peek: ${queue.peek()}") // Output: Queue peek: 3
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `CircularQueue` class uses an array to store the elements.
*   `front` points to the index of the front element.
*   `rear` points to the index of the rear element.
*   The modulo operator (`%`) is used to wrap around the array when `front` or `rear` reaches the end.
*   `size` keeps track of the number of elements in the queue.

### 4.  Implementing a Custom Queue with an Immutable List (Functional Approach)

Kotlin’s support for immutability makes it possible to create a queue using immutable lists. This is suitable for functional programming styles, offering thread safety and predictable state. Each enqueue or dequeue operation will return a *new* list, rather than modifying the existing one.  This approach avoids shared mutable state.

```kotlin
data class ImmutableQueue<T>(private val list: List<T> = emptyList()) {

    fun enqueue(element: T): ImmutableQueue<T> {
        return ImmutableQueue(list + element)
    }

    fun dequeue(): Pair<T?, ImmutableQueue<T>> {
        return if (list.isEmpty()) {
            null to this
        } else {
            Pair(list.first(), ImmutableQueue(list.drop(1)))
        }
    }

    fun peek(): T? {
        return list.firstOrNull()
    }

    fun isEmpty(): Boolean {
        return list.isEmpty()
    }

    fun size(): Int {
        return list.size
    }
}

fun main() {
    var queue = ImmutableQueue<Int>()
    queue = queue.enqueue(1)
    queue = queue.enqueue(2)
    queue = queue.enqueue(3)

    println("Queue size: ${queue.size()}") // Output: Queue size: 3

    val (first, newQueue) = queue.dequeue()
    println("Dequeued: $first") // Output: Dequeued: 1
    queue = newQueue

    println("Queue peek: ${queue.peek()}") // Output: Queue peek: 2
    println("Is queue empty? ${queue.isEmpty()}") // Output: Is queue empty? false
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `ImmutableQueue` is a data class holding an immutable list.
*   `enqueue` returns a *new* `ImmutableQueue` with the added element.
*   `dequeue` returns a `Pair` containing the dequeued element (or `null` if empty) and a *new* `ImmutableQueue` without that element.
*   This approach ensures that the original queue remains unchanged.

**Considerations:** While this is excellent for immutability, be aware that creating a new list on every operation can be less efficient than mutable queue implementations, especially for large queues with frequent enqueues and dequeues.  The cost of creating new list instances adds overhead.

## Use Cases of Queues

Queues are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

*   **Task Scheduling:**  Managing tasks to be executed in a specific order.  For example, a print queue manages print jobs in the order they were submitted.
*   **Buffering:** Temporarily storing data before processing it.  For example, a network buffer stores incoming data packets.
*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  A graph traversal algorithm that uses a queue to explore nodes level by level.
*   **Message Queues:**  Asynchronous communication between different components of a system. For example, RabbitMQ and Kafka are popular message queue systems.
*   **CPU Scheduling:**  Operating systems use queues to manage processes waiting to be executed by the CPU.
*   **Call Centers:**  Holding incoming calls in a queue until an agent is available.
