## What are IT General Controls (ITGC)?

ITGCs are the foundation of a secure and reliable IT environment. They are the basic controls that apply to all systems, applications, and data within an organization. They establish a framework for ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information.  These controls cover areas such as:

*   **Access Control:** Managing user access rights to prevent unauthorized access to systems and data. This includes authentication, authorization, and account management procedures.

*   **Change Management:** Controlling changes to systems and applications to ensure they are properly tested, authorized, and implemented without disrupting business operations.

*   **Backup and Recovery:** Regularly backing up critical data and having a documented recovery plan to restore systems and data in case of a disaster or outage.

*   **Computer Operations:** Managing the day-to-day operations of IT systems, including monitoring performance, managing incidents, and ensuring systems are available when needed.

*   **Security Management:** Implementing security measures to protect systems and data from threats, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and vulnerability management programs.

*   **Data Center and Network Security:** Implementing controls to secure the physical infrastructure (data centers) and the network that connects systems and users.

## Why is ITGC Certification Important?

Obtaining an ITGC certification offers numerous benefits for both individuals and organizations:

*   **Enhanced Skills and Knowledge:** Certification programs provide a structured learning path that equips individuals with a deep understanding of ITGC principles and best practices.
