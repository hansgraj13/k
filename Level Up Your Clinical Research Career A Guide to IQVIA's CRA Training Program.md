## What is a Clinical Research Associate (CRA)?

Before diving into the specifics of IQVIA's program, let's define the role of a CRA. A CRA, also known as a Clinical Monitor, is a healthcare professional who oversees clinical trials. They ensure that studies are conducted according to the study protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and regulatory requirements. The CRA acts as a liaison between the sponsor (the company funding the study) and the clinical trial site (the hospital, clinic, or doctor's office where the study is conducted).

**Key responsibilities of a CRA include:**

*   Site initiation visits: Assessing the suitability of a site for a clinical trial.
*   Site monitoring visits: Reviewing data, ensuring compliance, and verifying source documentation.
*   Site close-out visits: Ensuring all data is collected and the site is properly closed.
*   Investigator meetings: Participating in meetings to train investigators and site staff on the study protocol.
*   Communication: Maintaining regular communication with the study sponsor and the clinical trial site.
*   Regulatory compliance: Ensuring adherence to GCP guidelines and relevant regulations.
